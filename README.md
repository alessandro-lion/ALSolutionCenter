# ALSolutionCenter
Alternative GUI to HP Solution Center which does not use Macromedia Flash

After the HP Solution center stopped to work due to lack of Macromedia Flash which is no more runnable on a Windows 10 computer I made an essentials GUI / User Interface 
that will allow me to continue using the basic functionality of my legacy but working HP Deskjet F2280 All-in-One.

The tool has a Printer list which will show you only HP printers and allow you to select wich one to use with the 4 fucntion buttons.

1) Open the toolbox to check ink level or trigger the cartridge alignment
2) Start a document scan
3) Start a photo scan
4) Open the HP Guided Solution to see the troubleshooting steps for common issues

Likely it can be used as it is, or with few adaptations, with other different models, in case you are not really hands on development to build the tool you can use the clickonce setup 
I made, you can find it in the project root named Setup_Build_v_1_0_1.zip
